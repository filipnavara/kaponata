# Kaponata - Appium at scale

**Kaponata** manages your mobile device test farm for you, so you can run Appium tests at scale on iOS and Android devices.

With Kaponata, you can:

- Centrally manage your devices and run your Appium tests from your local machine.
- Perform manual tests or inspect the state of your device by remotely connecting to your devices.

Note: Kaponata is a heavy work in progress.
